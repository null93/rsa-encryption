 * Encryption.java - This class takes in a data file as well as a pair of either a private key or a
 * public key, depending if we are doing encryption or decryption, and operates onto the data
 * respectively.  It is important to note that we donâ€™t need separate classes for encryption or
 * decryption, since the only difference would be the key that is passed to this instance.
