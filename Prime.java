/**
 * Prime.java - This class will consist of static and non-static functions.  Some examples of static
 * functions within this class would be a function that determines if a passed Decimal instance is
 * prime or not.  This is used for user input authentication.  Other functions that are not static
 * within this class are able to load and return random prime numbers that will have to be preloaded
 * using a data file containing a list of primes.
